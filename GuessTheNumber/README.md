# Guess The Number 🎲

Welcome to the **Guess The Number** game! In this game, the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range. After each guess, the game provides a hint: "Higher" if the target number is larger, "Lower" if it is smaller, and "Correct!" when the guess is right. The game also keeps track of the number of attempts taken to guess the number.

## How to Play 🕹️

1. **Objective**: The goal is to guess the number generated by the game within the fewest attempts possible.
2. **Hints**:
   - If your guess is **lower** than the target number, the game will say **"Higher"**.
   - If your guess is **higher** than the target number, the game will say **"Lower"**.
   - If your guess is correct, the game will say **"Correct!"** and display the number of attempts taken.
3. **Restart Option**: After a successful guess, you can choose to play again.

## Requirements 🛠️

- Python 3.6 or higher

## How to Run ▶️

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GuessTheNumber.git
    cd GuessTheNumber
    ```

2. Run the game:
    ```bash
    python GuessTheNumber.py
    ```

3. To run the tests:
    ```bash
    python -m unittest test_GuessTheNumber.py
    ```

## Tests 🧪

The `test_GuessTheNumber.py` file includes unit tests that verify the core functionalities of the game:

- **test_guess_higher**: Ensures the game returns "Higher" when the guess is lower than the target number.
- **test_guess_lower**: Ensures the game returns "Lower" when the guess is higher than the target number.
- **test_guess_correct**: Verifies that the game returns "Correct!" when the guess matches the target number and that the attempt count is updated correctly.
- **test_attempts_count**: Confirms that the attempt counter increases with each guess.
- **test_reset_game**: Checks that the game resets correctly with a new target number and that the attempt count is reset.

## Code Overview 📝

- **`GuessTheNumber` Class**:
  - **`__init__`**: Initializes the game with a random target number within a defined range and sets the attempt counter to zero.
  - **`guess`**: Takes a player's guess and provides feedback ("Higher", "Lower", "Correct!") while incrementing the attempt counter.
  - **`reset_game`**: Resets the game with a new target number and resets the attempt counter.

## Example Gameplay

Upon starting the game, you will see:
```
Welcome to 'Guess the Number'! Try to guess the number between 1 and 100.
Enter your guess:
```

The game will respond to each guess with either:
- **Higher**: if the guess is too low
- **Lower**: if the guess is too high
- **Correct!**: if the guess matches the target number
